# CRU-resources
R script to enable usage of the aphiaID and higher taxonomic levels of the SMarTar-ID (https://smartar-id.app) labels in ecological analysis

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218904 

Includes: 
- RMD file (r script) to fromat Biigle CSV report 
- table of AphiaID for SMarTar-ID (https://smartar-id.app) labels 

installation 
- download the repository
- unizip it in a directory of your choice on your machine
- open the SmartrID reports.Rmd file
- follow the instructions on how to import your Biigle reports 
- run the script

Once it is finished, you should find

- a Site x species csv table (smartarID labels as rows, images as columns) 
- a Site x species csv table with the aphiaIDs and the higher taxonomic levels (smartarID labels + taxonomy as rows, images as columns)
- a species x site csv table (images as rows, smartarID labels as columns)
- a species with the aphiaIDs and the higher taxonomic levels x site csv table (images as rows, smartarID labels + taxonomy as columns)
